# gimp-outline-layer
A small gimp scheme script for quickly creating an outline for the current layer.
This small script was mostly made by me to practice some Lisp/Scheme via gimp and also making a common task I do in gimp more convenient to do.

# Installation 
Download the `script-fu-outline.scm` file from [the release page](https://github.com/tailoric/gimp-outline-layer/releases)  
Locate your script folder in Gimp via `Edit` -> `Preferences` -> `Folders` -> `Scripts`  
There you can find the paths to your script folder(s) or create a new one  
copy the path to the folder and put the `script-fu-outline.scm` file into that folder.

Then go to `Filters` -> `Script-Fu` -> `Refresh Scripts` and the script should be loaded now.

You can find the script under `Edit` -> `Outline Current Layer...`
